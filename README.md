# testlink-xml

## How to build and run

Clone the project using git to a location on your computer
Open the project in your favorite IDE (I've used Intellij Community Edition)
Create an executable jar by running the command `./gradlew deployApp`
Find the newly created executable jar file in the <projectlocation>/build/fxlauncher directory
Doubleclick fxlauncher.jar

Now you should be up and running.
